Aim:
   To construct a simple LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer and understand the working of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication within a LAN

Problem Statement:
  In computer networks, devices communicate using IP addresses at the network layer. However, data transmission at the data link layer requires MAC addresses. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to resolve the IP address to the corresponding MAC address.
  This project demonstrates the configuration and working of ARP using a simple LAN setup in Cisco Packet Tracer.
