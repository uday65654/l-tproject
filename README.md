1.Aim:
To construct a simple LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer and understand the working of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), which maps IP addresses to MAC addresses for communication within a LAN

2.Problem Statement:
In computer networks, devices communicate using IP addresses at the network layer. However, data transmission at the data link layer requires MAC addresses.   The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to resolve the IP address to the corresponding MAC address.
This project demonstrates the configuration and working of ARP using a simple LAN setup in Cisco Packet Tracer.

3. Scope of the Solution:
Provides practical understanding of ARP operation within a LAN.
Demonstrates how PCs in the same LAN communicate using ARP to discover each otherâ€™s MAC addresses.
Useful for students, IoT developers, and network engineers to understand packet-level communication.
Can be extended to industrial IoT networks, where machine-to-machine communication relies on ARP for address resolution.

5. Required Components:
>Software:
Cisco Packet Tracer (for LAN simulation)
GitHub (for documentation & project upload)
Screen recorder (OBS Studio, or built-in Windows recorder for demo video)
>Hardware (simulated in Packet Tracer):
2 or more PCs (end devices)
1 Switch (8-port)
LAN cables (Copper straight-through)
